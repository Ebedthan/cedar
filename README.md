## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

`darwin` is a fast tool to build (rapid) neighbor-joining trees bases on mash distance.
It takes as input the sequences (FASTA and FASTQ files are welcomed, compressed or not), compute the sketches and output a newick file of the tree.

The main advantages of darwin over others tools are:
- It uses the innovative approach of sketching algorithm [finch](https://github.com/onecodex/finch-rs) which is fast, have adaptive, count-based filtering (for FASTQs) and strandedness filtering.
- Reliable and fast neighbor-joining tree estimation using [speedytree](https://docs.rs/speedytree/latest/speedytree/).

`darwin` outputs the tree in newick format.

## üîß Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/Ebedthan/darwin.git
cd darwin

# if default Rust install directory is ~/.cargo
cargo install --path . --root ~/.cargo
darwin -h
```

## üí° Examples

```
# Compute rapid neighbor-joining tree of all files in a directory
darwin dir/*

# Compute rapid NJ tree using specific files
darwin file1.fa.gz file2.fq.xz file3.fna.bz2

# Compute canonical neighbor-joining tree
darwin -c dir/*
```
